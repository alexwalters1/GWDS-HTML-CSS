    <h1>Have you ever made pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put on the sauce first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>
    
    <!--<p> means paragraph it is NOT a heading-->

    <p>Making pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things we must do first. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to make many different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p>

    <!-- Make a list here // ol = ordered list adds numbers too // li = list item-->
    <h5>This is how you make pizza</h5>
    <p><small>There are some specific steps you need to take to make a pizza, we will list them here.</small></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza base</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Add the toppings</li>
        <li>Add the cheese</li>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <li>Cut</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>The toppings are different, they change for every occasion and taste. There is no order to toppings. So we will list them like this.</h6>

    <!--Make an unordered list // ul = unordered // has no numbers-->
    <ul>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
        <li>Peppers <strong>(never green)</strong></li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Jalapenos</li>
        <li>Pinapple <em>(only if you are crazy)</em></li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Inline elements are found in the block eg. <em> <strong> <small> etc.-->

    <!-- <a> = hyperlink and prior to </a> is the link text and will be highlighted.
